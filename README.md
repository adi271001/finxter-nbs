This code snippet plots the value of a portfolio for different monthly contributions over a period of 21 years.

* You specify the

** initial investment value,
** investment return,
** number of years, and
** monthly contributions.

* Then, you create a list to store the portfolio values over time for each monthly contribution.

* You calculate the portfolio values by multiplying the previous value of the portfolio by the investment return plus the contribution for each month. You repeat this calculation over the number of years minus one, taking the initial investment into account.

* You use Matplotlib to plot the portfolio values. The x-axis is the time in years and the y-axis is the portfolio value in dollars.

* You add a title and labels to the plot. You also add the end value for each of the portfolios to the plot with a text label. Finally, you display the plot.
